                <h1 style="text-align:center">Forgiveness</h1>
                <div class= "blogContent"><p id="line1"style="text-align:center">You have undeservingly allowed yourself to actually walk a mile
                in someone else’s shoes and now it’s time to take those shoes
                off!</p> Forgive, pardon, excuse, exonerate... Two people stand
                alone in a room. They exchange apologies for hurts passed
                between them. They embrace, smile and all is forgiven,
                forgotten. How often is this the truth of the process of
                forgiveness. For a long while I have tussled with forgiveness. I
                found that once I truly wanted to forgive, I didn’t
                authentically know how. Sure, I could say I forgive you, but my
                heart & mind would never get there in time to make the words
                true. So, how to do this? How to pardon the source of your hurt,
                pain, struggle. How to let go of something so completely that
                you feel free from the burden while not simultaneously feeling
                fear that letting go might be inviting this to happen again or
                letting the source of your pain off the hook. Then, after a
                dream I had one night, it hit me - forgiveness is not about
                letting someone or something off the hook. Forgiveness does not
                start by looking outside ourselves at all. Forgiveness starts so
                deep that one might miss it’s origins altogether. Forgiveness
                starts in recognizing who we were before all the pain -
                fearless, happy, free of baggage is who we still are and always
                have been. We have just forgotten. My dream was whimsical and
                beautiful with an air of the French baroque style although I
                have never been to France. With ladies of all skin shades
                looking beautiful and radiant, dressed in ball gowns and high
                wigs laughing carelessly under gilded gold ceilings that went on
                forever. As with any dream, the fantasy is hard to put to words.
                But, at one poignant moment, I remember a great desire to be
                free and happy, to join in the laughter and the fun, but a
                feeling of dred swept over me - how could I let go of all my
                reservations and not make myself voulnerable to more pain? As my
                dreaming mind pondered over this, a figure also resembling
                myself appeared. She walked up to me and spoke three invisible
                words, “Just. Let. Go.” And then she softly yet forcefully
                pushed me. I fell backwards in slow motion onto a tufted
                pillowed trampoline like surface. My body made contact with the
                surface and I was vigorously catapulted into the air. I was
                flying over everyone and I was laughing. My laughter surprised
                and delighted me all at once as I floated over a room of
                laughing women. Then, I looked into my own sleeping soul, the
                way the cast of the office would look boldly into the invisible
                cameras and told myself that - I was free! It was just that
                simple, let go and you are free. Ok, so how does one just let
                go? In reality, it can seem more complicated. Imagine you are a
                child of 4 or 5 years and you are becoming conscious of the
                world around you now. Someone points out a rope attached to a
                cart. The cart has a single small box on it. So, you decide to
                pick up the rope and begin dragging the cart behind. At first,
                your cart feels so light you barely notice it at all. Then, you
                see boxes from other peoples carts that they have left in your
                path. Some of these boxes are happy experiences that benefit us.
                Some boxes are profoundly insightful. Some boxes are filled with
                pain and abuse. Now, it only makes sense to pickup these boxes
                left by others and put them into your own cart so you can
                seemingly clear your path and keep moving forward. After all,
                some of these boxes hold such good things. After some years,
                life becomes heavy and you feel that something is weighing you
                down. You can’t see the rope in your own hands, grasping so
                tightly as if it was part of you, but you do remember those
                heavy boxes and the people or events that put them in your path
                to being with. There is a real resentment, hurt associated with
                the source of those boxes - if that person didn’t put their box
                in your path you wouldn’t have had to carry it and your life
                wouldn’t be so hard. So, we keep ourselves bound to the past, to
                that person or event that let some of their load spill over into
                our path. We let someone else’s burdens infect us as if we have
                no control of what we choose to let burden us, weigh us down. We
                become an angry, hurt, resentful victim of someone else’s pain.
                And we hate them for adding that weight to our load. We keep
                ourselves bound by not seeing that we are holding the rope that
                pulls our cart and we can decide what is added and what is
                removed. The boxes that were put in our way by others were never
                ours to begin with. Yes, perhaps we couldn’t avoid them coming
                into our space for a time, but it was never demanded that we
                pick up those boxes and carry them ourselves. We chose to pick
                them up. We added that pain to our load instead of leaving it
                behind. Someone or something might have introduced the
                hurt/fears to us, but it is our own fault for taking ownership.
                For taking on the bad pieces of others. For forgetting who we
                truly are. So, forgiveness then would be a conscious
                understanding that you hold the rope of experiences that have
                shaped you in your life. And, because you hold this rope, you
                can control what you choose to carry or not carry. Thus, the
                pain you are experiencing from the past hurts you carry is not
                the originators fault, it is yours. You have decided to continue
                being bound to this person or event because you have mistakenly
                thought that that experience is who you are, that it is yours.
                You can not separate your boxes from the boxes you’ve added from
                others. But once you get up the courage to sort through all
                these boxes that you have assigned to yourself and peak inside,
                you can start to let the bad boxes go and give them back to the
                originator. And, if the origin of that painful box was a family
                member, a friend, a co-worker, whoever; you can now unbind
                yourself from them by letting go of their box and giving it back
                to them. And finally, once you are unbounded from that person’s
                box, you not only feel freer and more yourself, you can also now
                look back at that source of the painful box and feel sorry for
                them or feel empathetic because now you are not carrying their
                load, but they still may be. You can have compassion because you
                allowed yourself to take on part of their pain and now that
                you’ve released them as your source of blame, you can have some
                degree of understanding that the person who hurt you must have
                picked up false ownership of that hurt from someone else along
                the way and you now know how burdensome that feels. You have
                taken empathy to a whole new level by absorbing someone else’s
                negative experience and making it your own. You have
                undeservingly allowed yourself to actually walk a mile in
                someone else’s shoes and now it’s time to take those shoes off!
                Now you can absolve that person or event from yourself. You can
                now forgive what is no longer part of you. And, hey, you may
                still never want to speak to that person again or become best
                friends, but you can free them from your rage and resentment.
                You don’t need to put a bad box in someone else’s path.</div>

                  Religion: Let It Heal Not Divide
                </h1>
                “If the concept of God has any validity or any use, it can only
                be to make us larger, freer, and more loving. If God cannot do
                this, then it is time we got rid of Him.” James Baldwin, The
                Fire Next Time

                Which of these ways is right? Which of these is “saved”? If you
                belong to one of these, you may be inclined to feel superior to
                the others or perhaps a pious pity for those “lost” souls going
                astray. But, what does not bring us together can tend to
                separate us if we are not aware. Religion drives our behavior,
                impacts our Conscience and dictates our world views. In this
                way, it seems that religion can be a powerful healer and
                motivator for our souls. Likewise, the pendulum can swing and
                when our religious beliefs clash with the beliefs/worldview of
                others, it may separate us on a very deep, soul level. As stated
                by leaders like Martin Luther King Jr or James Baldwin, “ the
                most segregated hour in American life is high noon on Sunday.”
                Of course, these leaders were speaking to the racial divide at
                the time. But as the Christian, the Muslim, the Lutheran skerry
